# Gift-Collect-Game
2D graphics MONO game with animation as my Final Project for Game Programming with Data Structure course.
I made a score-based game where a child picks up as many Christmas gifts as possible. 
When the user starts the game, there is a bar at the bottom of the screen. 
A child character will fall from the middle of the screen and bounce off when it hits the bar. 
It also bounces off when it hits the top, left, and right side of the screen. We have three rows of gifts at the top. 
When the child picks up a gift, the gift disappears, and the score increases by one. 
The game ends when the child falls to the bottom of the screen without contacting the bar. 
The user controls the direction of the bar through the left and right arrow keys.
